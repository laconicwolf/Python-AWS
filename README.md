# Python-AWS

A collection of scripts to create and/or interact with AWS resources using Python3. 

## Requirements

*An AWS account
*Python3 - I didn't test anything in Python 2 so not sure what will happen
*Boto3 - All scripts require it (pip install boto3 if you don't have it)
*AWS config and credentials file - Boto3 will look in ~.aws/ or C:\Users\YourName\.aws\
